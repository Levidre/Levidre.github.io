			<h2>About Azura</h2><br/>
			<h4><div><a href="Azura.nar" download="Azura.nar">Azura's download link</a></div></h4>
			<h3>Who is Azura ?</h3><br/>
			<div class="img_az">
				<div>
					<p>Azura's concept is : what if the player was able to transfer their own soul into the game Undertale ?</br>So Azura is Levidre if she transfered her soul into Undertale. But a player's soul has more determination than a normal human, too much determination.</p>
					<p>Azura stocks this determination in plus in two wings and a tail. Her dream being flying, the determination stocked as magie gave this form to her new magic members.</p>
					<p>She has a comic, Azurtale, telling her story. It's published on my tumblr in both english and french, with a <a href="https://azura-levidre.tumblr.com/azurtale">list of all the pages</a>.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div id="img_az"><img src="pictures/Azura.png" alt="It's a picture of Azura" title="Azura" height="275px" width="275px" /></div><br>
			<h3>Azura as ukagaka</h3><br/>
			<div>
				<p>After her journey in Undetale, people can summon Azura as a ghost to spend some time with her, to ask her some questions and to develope a relation depending on their actions.</p>
				<p>The ghost form of Azura is independant of the comic and has been developed at the same time as the story was written, it won't spoil anything that isn't published yet. Though some questions about the comic would be availabe once the pages published.</p>
				<p>You can <a href="Azura.nar" download="Azura.nar">download her</a>(if your browser don't download it, right click on the link and choose "Save link as..."). She is in a beta release though so expect some bugs.</p>
			</div><br/>
			<h3>Azura's menus</h3><br/>
			<div>
				<p>Her main menu opens by double clicking on her, take care of not punching her by trying to open it. It leads to some options and to the other menus and features.</p>
				<p>Her features menus won't change a lot but some options can appear or diseappear depending of your actions or of your relation with her.</p>
				<p>Her settings are in the <span>Config Menu</span> and some useful stuffs as information or emptying the recycle bin are in the <span>Functions</span> menu. </p>
			</div><br/>
			<h3>The music player</h3><br/>
			<div>
				<p>Inspired from FLELE's one and using the same plugins, it has a playlist system allowing the user to save their playlists to switch from one to an other. The last playlist not saved would be saved in a temporary one, so the user wouldn't lose their playlist if they forget to save it before loading a new one.</p>
				<p>Different playing modes are available and the music player can be controlled with the keyboard. It has a dashboard too, an interface that would make the access to the current playlist easier in plus of its buttons.</p>
			</div><br/>
			<h3>The AI</h3><br/>
			<div>
				<p>The <span>You want to say her something</span> option in the menu. It's the most complex feature in Azura.</p>
				<p>In plus of interacting with Azura, the purpose was to be able to write directly questions by typing them in an input box. It started "simple" but became more and more complex, it has been restructured two times and is still not finished.</p>
				<p>The AI is divised in two part, the understanding part and the responding part and for now the responding part isn't fully implemented and the understanding part has a bug keeping many propositions in the same sentence to work. Of course, Azura would tell you if something isn't implemented yet. Though even if it's not a lot regarding all that need to be, a lot of stuffs are implemented and you can already have Azura's opinion about some stuffs, if she knows them. If she doesn't know them, you can teach her them.</p>
				<p>The final goal is making Azura able to have a normal discussion with the user. Though it's long to implement and very complex. For now, the next steps to reach are finishing implementing all the responses, giving her more vocabulary and finishing her self-learning feature.</p>
