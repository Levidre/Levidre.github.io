<h2>About SAORI</h2>
<h3>What's a SAORI ?</h3>
<div>
	<p>A SAORI (Supplemental Archive Onto Restricted Intelligence) is a plugin a developer can add to their ghost to give it some features.</p>
	<p>A developer would create a SAORI or use one for their ghost either to simplify a feature that would be complicated to implement directly in the ghost or because it's not possible to do in the ghost's programming language.</p>
	<p>SAORI for basewares exist and are generally called plugins.</p>
</div>
<h3>How does it works ?</h3>
<div>
	<p>A ghost communicates with a SAORI the same way it communicates with the baseware, with the Sakura Script Transfer Protocol. Therefore a SAORI has an interface to communicate in SSTP, though a SAORI called proxy.dll can serve as an interface when one doesn't have its own.</p>
	<p>AYA/YAYA ghosts use SAORI with the FUNCTIONEX() or the SAORI() function, the commands they send to the SAORI depends on the SAORI itself. That's why generally a SAORI has a readme listing the commands and their order in its distribution file.</p>
</div>
<h3>Most common SAORI</h3>
<div>
	<p>Most english ghosts have gomi.dll and saori_cpuid.dll. The first SAORI is used to empty the recycle bin and the second one to show the user information about their computer. If you're familiar with english ghosts, it's generally a <span>System information</span> option in one of their menus.</p>
	<p>Like FLELE, Azura has mciaudior.dll and mcidonut.dll, a SAORI to play music from a file and an other to play from a CD. The advantage of using a SAORI to play music instead of making SSP do it is the variety of files that can be played.</p>
	<p>For plugins (SAORI for basewares), SSP generally comes with Swiss Army Knife and a plugin called Discord Rich Presence can be installed to make Discord aware of ghosts.</p>
