<h2>About Updates</h2>
<h3>Azura's update system</h3>
<div>
	<p>You can update Azura by pushing Ctrl+U or going in her right click menu if you're on SSP.
	<br>She would tell it when there is an update at the end of her booting dialogue.</p>
	<p>Each update, Azura has a notice with all the changes brought by it. This notice opens after the update but is accessible in her Functions menu too, so you can always check it.</p>
</div>
<h3>Last update</h3>
<div>
	<p>It solved a surface issue and added a few dialogues.</p>
</div>
<h3>Previous updates</h3>
<div>
	<p>The emergency update, the website scared me so I added something to prevent the updates to break if it shuts down with a backup repository on github. Azura will ask you if you want to use it if her update fails. There were new animations and new communication dialogues with other ghosts added too.</p>
