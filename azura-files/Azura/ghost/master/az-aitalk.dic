//---------------------------AI Talk--------------------------
//Alright, this is it! The bread and butter of your ghost. This is where all their random conversations are stored. Of all the .dic files, this is the one you will probably be adding stuff to and updating the most as new dialogue comes to your mind. It is relatively simple in that there aren't many functions or real coding involved with this file, but there are a few cool tricks you can do within randomtalk that can make dialogue with interesting effects, so I'll point them out as we go along.
//I'm going to leave a lot of examples of different types of dialogue in here that you can study if the possibilities they present intrigue you. Study them carefully!

//Make sure to read the walkthrough (http://www.ashido.com/ukagaka/walkthrough.html) for more details about how to properly format ghost dialogue!
//I will reiterate that you should be editing these in Notepad++, and in particular, you should set the Language to C (or Java I guess) to properly highlight all the text. It will make things A LOT EASIER for you, trust me! It will also help you keep track of your brackets in case you forget some. If you click on a line with a bracket in Notepad++, it should highlight where the other bracket ends, or turn purple if there's no finishing bracket (which you should definitely fix!)
//It will also highlight my commented lines in green, so you'll know where they are. Any line beginning with // is a commented line that the code will not read. It's just for your reference!

//--AiTalk
//Leave this alone.
//Advanced users, this is mostly setting up whether or not dialogue is in a chain before it displays. Again, you can leave it alone unless you want to screw around with chains for some strange reason.

//--RandomTalk 
 //Alright, here we go! This is where ALL your ghost's random dialogue will go! These are the conversations that they'll have with you or each other that pop up depending on the talk rate defined in menu.dic (or if you ignored that, set in bootend.dic in the first boot, which would be every five minutes).
 
//*********************Advanced User Info*******************************
//These text boxes are meant for those who have an interest in expanding or using more complicated functions in their ghost. Also for my own reference in the future since I plan on using this template too, haha. If you have no interest in any of this and just want to keep things as simple as possible, feel free to skip these boxes.

//ALL your random dialogue NEEDS to be in RandomTalk. You can't link to other functions or something from within RandomTalk, or a separate pool of convos in another .dic file, as far as I can tell. So, how do you then set up certain pools of dialogue that only happen when certain settings are in place (for example, when there are three characters on the screen instead of two) and won't happen when they are false? Basically, you just need to be creative with your if statements. You can nest a ton of ifs and elses in RandomTalk, and if you keep them straight, you can make a lot of dialogue here customized to whatever situation you can come up with. BUT again, you can't call other dialogue into here! I go more into how to set up a "mode" like that in the coding page of the walkthrough site.
//I GUESS you could set up more dialogue in an envelope perhaps (see word.dic) or another .dic file and then call it in here using envelopes, but that seems a bit redundant. Maybe someone else can think of a use for that though.

//The closest you can get to linking to outside dialogue is via chains, but I'll talk more about chains when we get to them. Being creative with chains can open up a lot of opportunities for you, such as presenting the user with choices every now and then, which I'm pretty sure you can't do within RandomTalk. Maybe you can, I usually do it via chains though. I'll have to experiment with this later.
//***********************************************************************

RandomTalk //: nonoverlap
{
	/* //--Chains
	//Chain dialogue is unique. A dialogue chain consists of multiple bits of dialogue that get called in order over a period of time.
	
	//"\0\s[0]This is the first part of a chained dialogue.\w8\1\s[10]Second part to come when we next speak.\e:chain=firstchain"
	
	//Note here that instead of ending the dialogue with the normal end tag of \e, it ends with \e:chain=firstchain. This will link down below to a chunk of code outside RandomTalk called firstchain. You can scroll down and find it now if you want. You can name your chain anything you want, it'd just follow the same format of \e:chain=yourchainsname, and you can have a long series of chains as well. Once a dialogue has entered a chain, they won't say any other random dialogue until the chain is finished.
	
	//"\0\s[0]This will lead to the second piece of chained dialogue.\w8\1\s[10]This will have another chain attached to it.\e:chain=secondchain"
	
	//Here, this chain will link to another chain to continue the conversation. You can scroll down to the section on chains to see this in action.
	
	//--If statements
	//You can put if statements in RandomTalk! They don't even need Else statements, unless you want to keep two sets of statements completely separate - for example, you have one pool of conversations for when there are two characters, and one for if there are three characters. You wouldn't want these to overlap, so you'd put one pool in the if statement and the other in the else. Most of the time though, you won't need an Else statement for these, since they'll mostly only be adding in dialogue if the if statement is true. 
	
	if nowshell == "default_shell" //This checks to see what shell they're currently using. You may remember this value being defined back in bootend.dic. If they're in their default shell...
	{
	//Then these conversations are available! Note the brackets enclosing this set of dialogue.
	"\0\s[10]Here is dialogue related to the default shell.\w8You can use this to comment on clothing your ghost is wearing.\e"
	
	"\0\s[10]Here is more dialogue related to the default shell.\e"
	}
	
	//You can also put in multiple ifs checking for the same thing to vary the responses. In this case, it's checking to see if they're wearing another shell. You don't need to use elseifs for this! Just an if is fine.
	if nowshell == "Hypothetical Shell that doesn't actually exist"
	{
	"\0\s[10]This is dialogue related to a shell we don't actually have.\w8Unless it somehow pops into existence.\e"
	
	"\0\s[10]This is more dialogue related to a hypothetical shell we don't actually have.\w8It's not happening.\e"
	}
	//After the if statement is done, you can continue with dialogue as normal. As you can see, you can move the ifs around in here, it doesn't really matter. You may want to stick them all in one place together if you want to keep track of them, or you can scatter them around your dialogue as you please. It's up to you. These two lines below are just normal random dialogue.
	//And here we're going to go back into ifs! You see, you can space out your ifs with normal dialogue if you want, as I just mentioned. Anyway, you can set up if statements to check for a lot of different things! One of the cooler ones I think are ones set to check for time. This one for example checks if the month is December.

	if month == 11
	{
	}
	//These ifs check what day of the week it is.
	if weekday == 1
	{
		"\0\s[10]This is dialogue for Monday..\e"
		
		"\0\s[10]This is more dialogue for Monday.\e"
	}
		
	
	//--Double Envelopes
	//If you've gone through word.dic, you may remember a list with two sets of values on each line. This is how you would call something like that! For this example, we'll use the double envelope that cindysuke made that has a Korean word and its definition. This can be a bit complicated, so pay close attention.
	
	{
	_korean = lessonkor //Here, the envelope "lessonkor" is stored as a new value called _korean. You can name the new value anything you like. 
	_korword = _korean[0] //The first part of the envelope's list is the Korean word, so it will be called _korword. The first value of the _korean list is _korean[0], so that value is then stored in _korword.
	_kormean = _korean[1] //This is the second item on the list, in this case the meaning of the Korean word, so it's called _kormean. The second value of the _korean list is _korean[1], so that value is then stored in _kormean.
	
	"Here is an example of a double envelope. The Korean word is %(_korword).\w8\0\s[10]The word means %(_kormean).\e"
	
	//As you can see here, you then use the values we set above for _korword and _kormean up there in the dialogue as our new envelopes. If you're planning on using a double envelope like this, study how this works very carefully! Most of the time, you can get away with just copying this whole bit of code and changing the names of the values as you need - doubled envelope to _doubled, _korword to _doubleitem1 or _kormean to _doubleitem2, or whatever. I'm not sure if the underscores are necessary, but you might as well play it safe and keep them.
	//You could possibly set up an envelope with three or four or any number of values in it, then just assign them increasing numbers like _doubleitem[4] or _doubleitem[5] in the dialogue set up here, but I've personally never tried it.
	
	//Additional Note - You can't test this kind of dialogue in Script Input. You'll have to wait until it comes up naturally in your ghost's random dialogue.
	
	//Those uninterested in double envelopes can delete this section.
	}
	//--Multiple Responses
	//Here's another example of multiple responses. This one will let you randomly choose something to say in the middle of a sentence.
	
	{
	"\0\s[10]Say either black or white.\w8What if I say " 
	-- //opening dashes
	"green"
	"red"
	"purple"
	"orange"
	"yellow"
	"magenta" //Notice here I added a tag for his thoughtful pose. If he chooses magenta, he'll do this pose. You can set up individual expressions for each potential choice this way.
	-- //closing dashes
	" instead?\w8\0\n\n[half]Then you're not really cooperating.\w8\1\n\n[half]Sounds about right.\e"
	
	//You can see that this follows the formula of the above, although there's only one set of multiple responses in here, then Triangle continues with his sentence. You can use this feature in many different ways if you're creative.
	}
	
	"\0\s[10]\f[height,20]These words are really large.\f[height,default]\w8These words are a normal size. \w8\f[height,6]These words are small.\f[height,default]\e"
	
	//You can use other fancier SakuraScript bits in your dialogue if you want to get font effects, although I won't get too much into them here. In this case, \f[height,20] changes the height of the font, in this case to 20 or to 6, and then \f[height,default] changes them back to normal. I touch more on this in the SakuraScript page of the walkthrough.
	
	"\0\s[10]\f[strike,true]These words are struck out.\f[strike,default]\w8\1\s[10]\f[sub,true]These words are a subscript.\f[sub,false] \f[sup,true]These words are a superscript.\f[sup,false] \f[underline,true]These words are underlined.\f[underline,default] \f[bold,true]These words are bold.\f[bold,false] \f[italic,true]These words are italic.\f[italic,false] \f[color,186,146,112]These words are a color.\f[color,default] This tag would return to default.\f[default]\e"
	
	//Here's a list of similar tags you may find useful. You can see they function much like <b> or <i> tags in html. You just enclose the piece of text you want to change with them. Note that they start with \f[word,true] to turn it on, then \f[word,false] or \f[word,default] to turn it off. I assume you can tell what the tags do by the text they enclose.
	//For the \f[color] tag, the three colors listed are the RGB values of the color you want to use for your text. Change them to whatever color you want to use. \f[default] can be an easy way to quickly go back to the default word setting in your balloon after messing with colors and effects a lot.
	
	//Along the same lines as above, you can use \_a[address] to link to certain things. Note that it ends with \_a to close the link. It's very similar to <a href=address> and </a> in html.
	
	"\_sWe are saying this dialogue at the same time.\e" 
	
	//This dialogue uses a unique tag, \_s. \_s makes it so both characters will speak the same words at the same time. Try it in Script Input to see how it works. I talk about it a little more on the walkthrough page for scripting.

//Here is where you will put your bits of chain dialogue. They are outside of RandomTalk, which makes them a bit more flexible as I mentioned above. As you can see, this function is called "firstchain", which was the same tag we put at the end of the chain in aitalk with \e:chain=firstchain.

//Azura's chain are in an other file.

firstchain

	"\0\s[10]Here is the second part of the chain.\w8Will there be more?\e:chain=end"

//Pay careful attention to the CHAIN text and double brackets for these. Double brackets, CHAIN, dialogue, double brackets, CHAIN. If you are planning on making chains, I'd recommend just copying and pasting the chain example here and changing the dialogue and name of the function as you need. Less likely for mistakes to happen, you know?
//Note also it ends with \e:chain=end, basically ending the chain.

secondchain

//**** OnSurfaceRestore *****************************************************************
//OnSurfaceRestore is a handy function. What this does is that after a short period of time, the ghost will go back to its default pose, so you won't have a ghost stuck in one expression for too long. It's also helpful if you've made one of the characters disappear using \s[-1] in dialogue and didn't bring them back at the end of it. This will do that for you.
//I'm going to comment out the if/else statements in this because the circumstances in which they'd come up seem pretty unlikely and unnecessary if you're just going to be making a simple ghost. You can just leave this function alone and move on if you want. However, if you do want to use them, just uncomment the lines by deleting the slashes and fill in the info as you need.

//*********************Advanced User Info*******************************
//You can put if statements in OnSurfaceRestore to make exceptions for certain poses, or to make sure that once they're in a certain pose, they stay in that pose. For example, if you turn my Hunter and Smoker ghost into eggplants, there's a check for the their eggplant pose numbers to make sure they STAY eggplants when OnSurfaceRestore is called.
//You can also use OnSurfaceRestore to clean up things that might be left on the screen, primarily from using p[number]\s[] to call up other objects or characters. Just make sure to add a p[number]\s[-1] to OnSurfaceRestore, and that should get rid of it each time the ghost cleans itself up.
