	//Some brief explanation about what's going on in those REPLACE lines! Basically, the function looks through the script and looks for a defined word or set of words. In this case, it's "Anchor 1". It then replaces "Anchor 1" with the second set of text, "\_a[anchor1]Anchor 1\_a". \_a if you recall is the dialogue code for linking something, so this is linking the words Anchor 1 to something called anchor1 set up in the next function, OnAnchorSelect.
	//This is being used to change a word into a link, but you could conceivably use this to replace any text with any other kind of text if you wanted. I tried to replace . with .\w8  as I mentioned above which did not turn out well, haha, but there are probably other ways this could be used successfully.

	
//--OnAnchorSelect
//OnAnchorSelect runs whenever someone clicks one of the links as specified above, or a link that begins with http://.

OnAnchorSelect
{
	if "http://" _in_ reference0 //checking to see if the link is a web address
	{
	"\j[%(reference0)]\e" // \j is a tag that will open a specified url in the user's browser of choice. This basically just tells the ghost to open the webpage stored in reference0, which would be the address that the user just clicked. I didn't get too much into \j in the walkthrough page because I have literally never used it except here.

	else //if it's NOT a web address
