Azura is an original character I made. She comes from a comic I'm writting about the player transferring their soul into the game Undertale.

In contrary of the character Frisk, she would be talkative. She has her own personality that you could discover interacting with her. The ways to interact with her are as in Undertale, ACT and ITEM, so you could offer her some things. You can ask her questions too.
But there is an other way to interact with her, Azura has an AI so you can say her something and she would respond to you depending of what you said. Not all the responses are done and Azura would say if she cannot respond. You would be able to directly teach her words but a self-learning feature exists and can be activated in her Config Menu (not very accurate for now and can generate problems in the responses). You can send me the dictionary you created with her so I would integrate the missing words into her.

Azura has the usual ghost features as checking the emails, emptying the recycle bin and putting a desktop wallpaper. But she has an other feature inspired from the ghost FLELE : she has a music player.

So, about the music player, you can give files to Azura, playlists or folders and she would add the songs to her playlist, then you would be able to save her playlist to listen it with her later. You can open a playlist you saved and update it if you modify it. When you open a playlist, you always can come back to the previous playlist no saved so you wouldn't lose it. If you have a music CD, she would add the songs of this CD to her current playlist, but wouldn't save them with the others when you save the playlist. When activated, you can use your keyboard to control the music player, the keybord commands can be changed in the music player settings. Finally, there is different ways to play the songs, you can listen one song once, the same song looping, the whole playlist once, the whole playlist looping or all the songs randomly (Azura wouldn't play the same song twice until she played all the songs once). There is some internet downloaded songs that she isn't able to play though, the reason is unknown.

Azura and you can build a relationship by being together and interacting each other. She greets you when you open her and if you speak to her, she would remember what you like or not. After a little time (and a relationship progress), some things are unlockable and she would behave differently with you depending of what you did.

Some sounds used come from Undertale and belong to Toby Fox.

Azura will tell you when you boot her if there is an update at the end of her booting dialogue. You can check in the functions menu if there is one though.

Thought a lot of stuffs are done, bugs can exist and stuffs would be added.They would be added during the differents updates, each new update would add new things or improve others listed in a notice. You can find it in the functions menu if you want to know again what was the content of the update.

Feel free to ask me anything about Azura or ghost coding and to send me your dictionary or some feedback to https://azura-levidre.tumblr.com .

Have fun with her !
