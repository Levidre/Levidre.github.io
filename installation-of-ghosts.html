			<h2>Installing a ghost</h2><br/>
			<h3>Installation of SSP</h3><br/>
			<div>
				<p>To install SSP, you go on <a href="http://ssp.shillest.net/" target="_blank">its   site</a>, you click on the rose block and download it. Then you can install it.<br>By default, SSP is in japanese. To switch it into english, there is a language option in the right click menu, it's the fourth option starting from the bottom.</p>
			</div><br/>
			<h3>A right click menu, and some tools</h3><br/>
			<div class="img_EM">
				<div>
					<p>SSP isn't a normal program, it doesn't have a tool bar or anything like other programs. It's only something to run ghosts and that have some features in plus of them.</p>
					<br/><p>When you first boot up SSP, a girl speaking japanese appears. It's Emily, SSP's default ghost. If you right click on her, you would make a menu appears. It's the right click menu, SSP menu.<br>In this menu you can find some reference sites of the ghost, SSP settings (audio, the ghost who would appear when it boots up,...), the update and the uninstall buttons, the informations about the current and all the ghosts, and ghosts management in general.</p>
					<p>You can find other features in this menu as a messenger, speech recognition, voice synthesis, plugins and dev tools.</p>
					<br/><p>Despite it being SSP menu, the ghost dev can change the name of the buttons and the appearance of the menu for their ghost.<br>This buttons aren't used only by SSP but by other ukagaka platforms such as Crow and Materia, it's more buttons for platforms menus than for SSP in particular.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div id="img_EM""><img src="pictures/RC-menu.png" alt="Supposely Emily's SSP menu" title="Emily's SSP menu" height="350px" /></div>
			<h3>How to use ghosts</h3><br/>
			<div>
				<p>Once SSP is booted and a ghost displayed, you can double click on it to open the ghost's menu. Though the way of opening the menu or to interact with the ghost can change from one ghost to an other, so reading the readme of ghosts is <span>very</span> important.</p>
				<br/><p>The ghost in itself has its own settings in its menu and its own features. They can change their talk rates and the features available depend on the ghost.</p>
				<p>A ghost has hitboxes. You can pet them, punch them or whatever the hitboxes allow you. They are described in the readme as the ways to interact with the ghost.</p>
				<br/><p>To install a ghost, you just drag and drop its file on an other ghost. Same method for installing a balloon (ghost speech bubble) or a shell for a ghost (a ghost appearance, a shell is for a ghost in particular, only the ghost whose this shell is destinated would install it).</p>
			</div><br/>
			<h3>More precisions</h3><br/>
			<div>
				<p>Ghosts can be very different from one to an other. That's because there is only a few things imposed for their development, so developers are free to do whatever they want with them. The common point between all ghosts is that they are here to entertain.</p>
				<p>However they usually have a lot in common. Most ghosts open their menu by double clicking on their body, are punched by clicking or double clicking on their face and pet by moving the mouse on the top of their head.</p>
				<br/><p>Ghosts' speech bubble is called a balloon and can be changed. Some ghosts have their own balloon their dev would usually provide you at the same time as the ghost's file. They are completely independant of the ghost and can be changed in the right click menu.</p>
